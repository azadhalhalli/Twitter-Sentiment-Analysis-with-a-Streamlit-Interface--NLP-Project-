Twitter Sentiment Analysis with a Streamlit Interface (NLP Project)

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It includes a Streamlit-based interface that allows users to input a topic or keyword, fetch recent tweets through web scraping, and analyze their sentiment in real time.

Project Overview

Social media platforms like Twitter are rich sources of public opinions. This project utilizes Twitter data to analyze sentiments (positive, neutral, or negative) expressed in tweets. It features a simple and interactive web application built with Streamlit, providing users with a seamless way to visualize sentiment distributions and explore the context of tweets.

Features

	•	Web Scraping:
Tweets are collected in real time using the Tweepy library or alternative scraping tools (e.g., SNScrape).
	•	Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiments are classified as positive, neutral, or negative using pre-trained models or custom-trained classifiers.
	•	Streamlit Interface:
A user-friendly dashboard that allows:
	•	Topic-based tweet search.
	•	Sentiment visualization using interactive charts.
	•	Detailed display of scraped tweets and their sentiment labels.
	•	Data Visualization:
Interactive visualizations such as pie charts, bar graphs, and word clouds are used to summarize the results.

Technologies Used

	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries:
	•	Web Scraping: Tweepy, SNScrape
	•	NLP: NLTK, TextBlob, VaderSentiment, Hugging Face Transformers
	•	Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
	•	Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
	•	Web App Development: Streamlit
	•	Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit Sharing (for deployment)

How It Works

	1.	Input a Topic:
Enter a topic or keyword in the Streamlit interface.
	2.	Fetch Tweets:
The app collects recent tweets using Tweepy or SNScrape.
	3.	Sentiment Analysis:
Each tweet is analyzed for its sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) using NLP techniques.
	4.	Visualize Results:
Sentiment distribution and key insights are presented through interactive charts and a word cloud.

Sentiment Analysis Approach

	•	Preprocessing:
Tweets are cleaned by removing stop words, URLs, special characters, and emojis.
	•	Sentiment Models:
The project uses a combination of tools, such as:
	•	VaderSentiment for rule-based analysis.
	•	Transformers (e.g., BERT) for deep learning-based analysis.

Streamlit App Features

	•	Search Bar:
Enter any keyword to scrape and analyze related tweets.
	•	Sentiment Summary:
View the sentiment distribution via pie charts and bar graphs.
	•	Tweet Display:
See individual tweets along with their sentiment classification.
	•	Word Cloud:
A visual summary of the most common words in the tweets.

Deployment

The project is deployed using Streamlit Sharing, enabling easy access through a web browser.

Future Enhancements

	•	Incorporating real-time sentiment updates with live Twitter streams.
	•	Improving the accuracy of sentiment analysis by fine-tuning BERT or similar transformer-based models.
	•	Adding multilingual support for analyzing tweets in multiple languages.
	•	Providing downloadable reports for analyzed data.
